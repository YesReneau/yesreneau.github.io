		<p><h2> My Tutoring Services </h2></p>

		<p>My tutoring covers everything from the specifics of U.S. college essay writing (e.g. how to structure the essay, how to make a sentence 'pop', etc.) to the generalities of the U.S. application process (e.g. what to include in your application, how to know what your application is saying about you, etc.).</p>

		<p>My rates are the following (and subject to change):</p>
		<li>Face-to-face online tutoring: $60/hour (I charge by the half hour)</li>
		<li>Long essay (501+ words): $45/essay revision</li>
		<li>Medium essay (251-500 words): $22.50/essay revision ($45 minimum per student)</li>
		<li>Short essay (0-250 words): $10/essay revision ($30 minimum per student)</li>

		<p>For the face-to-face online tutoring, I use Google Hangouts.  For the essay revisions, you would send me your essays, I would read them, and then I would send them back with revisions via email.</p>

		<p>I prefer that all of the payments are processed through Venmo (but if that doesn't work for you, we can discuss other payment options). For face-to-face tutoring, I ask for my students to send me payment at least 24 hours before the Google Hangout session.  For essay revisions, I ask my students to send payment at the time that they send me their essay (give or take a few minutes).</p>

		<p>If all of this sounds good, email me at yesreneau@gmail.com and we can discuss it further.  Additionally, if you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.  Talk to you soon!</p>
